# exercise description

# `03` Building a layout

Let's practice a little bit more about using JSX for creating HTML.

Now we have another object that is just a bit more complex than the last one.

# :speech_balloon: Instructions

You have a `data` object that contains Bob Dylans information (image, title, etc).

```js
const data = {
  image: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Bob_Dylan_-_Azkena_Rock_Festival_2010_2.jpg/800px-Bob_Dylan_-_Azkena_Rock_Festival_2010_2.jpg",
  cardTitle: "Bob Dylan",
  cardDescription: "Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American singer/songwriter, author, and artist who has been an influential figure in popular music and culture for more than five decades.",
  button: {
    url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan",
    label: "Go to wikipedia"
  }
};
```

Use the information contained in `data` to render a bootstrap card, for example: The card's title will be the `data.cardTitle`, etc.
